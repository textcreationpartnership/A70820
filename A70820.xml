         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Approbation which has been given by those of the greatest Skill in <hi>Musick,</hi> and the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I have met with from a number of worthy Subscribers do give me just reason to hope, that this Collection of <hi>Divine Songs</hi> (tho' the first of this nature extant) will find a kind Reception with the best of Men.</p>
            <p>The Youthful and Gay have already been entertain'd with variety of rare Compositions, where the lighter Sportings of Wit have been Tun'd by the most artful Hands, and made at once to gratify a delicate Ear, and a wanton Curiosity.</p>
            <p>I now therefore address to others, who are no less <hi>Musical,</hi> though they are more <hi>Devout.</hi> There are many Pious Persons, who are not only just Admirers, but excellent Judges too, both of <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Wit;</hi> to these a singular Regard is due, and their exquisite Relish of the former ought not to be pall'd by an unagreeable Composition of the later. Divine <hi>Hymns</hi> are therefore the most proper Entertainment for them, which, as they make the sweetest, and indeed the only, Melody to a <hi>Religious Ear,</hi> so are they in themselves the very Glory and Perfection of <hi>Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis the meanest and most Mechanical Office of this <hi>Noble Science</hi> to play upon the Ear, and strike the Fancy with a superficial Delight; but when Holy and Spiritual Things are its Subject, it proves of a more subtile and refined Nature, whilst darting it self through the Organs of Sense, it warms and actuates all the Powers of the Soul, and fills the Mind with the brightest and most ravishing Contemplations. <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> have in all Ages been accounted Divine,
<pb facs="tcp:50321:3"/> and therefore they cannot be more naturally employed, than when they are conversant about <hi>Heaven,</hi> that Region of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> from whence they are derived.</p>
            <p>Now as to this present Collection, I need say no more than that the <hi>Words</hi> were penn'd by such Persons, as are, and have been, very Eminent both for Learning and Piety; and indeed, he that reads them as he ought, will soon find his Affections warm'd, as with a Coal from the Altar, and feel the Breathings of Divine Love from every Line. As for the <hi>Musical Part,</hi> it was Compos'd by the most Skilful Masters of this Age; and though some of them are now dead, yet their Composures have been review'd by Mr. <hi>Henry Purcell,</hi> whose tender Regard for the Reputation of those great Men made him careful that nothing should be published, which, through the negligence of Transcribers, might reflect upon their Memory. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Musical</hi> and <hi>Devout</hi> cannot want Matter both to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Skill, and heighten their Devotion; to which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Purposes that this Book may be truly effectual is the hearty desire of</p>
